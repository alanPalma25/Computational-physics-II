This notebook contains the analysis of results obtained using the Python package **orbits**, originally developed as part of the midterm exam. The **orbits** package simulates, visualizes, and animates the motion of a planet orbiting a black hole using various numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It supports both classical and relativistic gravitational models and provides static as well as animated visualizations of the orbit.

**Note**: You can find the package here: [orbits package](../../orbits)
