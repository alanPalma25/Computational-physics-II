# Computational Physics II
Here is all the coursework completed during Computational Physics II, taught by Professor Wladimir Banda at Yachay Tech University. The curse was taught from Sepember to December correspontig to the eighth semester (four year) of the degree in physics.

## About this repository:
- All the topics covered are detailed in the course syllabus. In general, the course covered numerical solution of ODEs in physics, software desing in python, parallel computing, numerical methods for PDEs in physics and some aplications in computational physics.
- This repository contains all assignments, quizzes, and exams completed during the course. Additionally, each section includes the respective marked coursework for all notebooks.
- The entire course was conducted using Python.

**Note:** It is important to mention that all the problems and exercises were designed by [Prof. Wladimir Banda](https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-2) and were typically assigned to be completed within a week.
